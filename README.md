ODKSM is a tool to quickly and easily create more than one Arma 3 server instance and manage its settings, mods and keys. It does 
so by intelligently using symlinks, which keeps the server instance's folder small, easy to update and archive.

It mainly caters to dedicated server maintainers, but could surely come in handy for mission makers. 

Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/CarloDePieri/odk_servermanager/wiki) for detailed instructions on how to install and use the tool.
